## Introduction

Feast (Feature Store) is an open-source feature store that enables teams to define, manage, and serve machine learning features in production. By providing a unified platform for feature storage and retrieval, Feast ensures consistency between training and serving environments, thereby reducing the complexity of machine learning pipelines.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Feature Management**: Store and manage all your machine learning features in a single repository, promoting reusability and collaboration across teams. 

- **Seamless Integration**: Integrate with various data sources and machine learning frameworks, allowing for flexible and scalable feature engineering workflows. 

- **Consistent Feature Serving**: Ensure that features used during model training are identical to those used during inference, preventing training-serving skew. 

- **Low-Latency Online Serving**: Serve features to models in real-time with minimal latency, supporting high-performance production systems. 

- **Historical Feature Retrieval**: Access historical feature data to facilitate model training and backtesting, ensuring robust model development.

- **Feature Versioning and Lineage**: Track feature versions and their lineage to maintain reproducibility and understand feature evolution over time. 

- **Extensible Architecture**: Customize and extend Feast to fit your organization's specific needs, leveraging its modular design.
